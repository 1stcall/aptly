Aptly is a swiss army knife for Debian repository management.

It allows to: ("+" means planned features)

* make mirrors of remote Debian/Ubuntu repositories, limiting by components/architectures
* take snapshots of mirrors at any point in time, fixing state of repository at some moment of time
* publish snapshot as Debian repository, ready to be consumed by apt
* merge two or more snapshots into one (+)
* filter repository by search query, pulling dependencies when required (+)
* controlled update of one or more packages in snapshot from upstream mirror, tracking dependencies (+)
* publish self-made packages as Debian repositories (+)

Current limitations:

* source packages, debian-installer and translations not supported yet
* checksums and signature are not verified while downloading
* deleting created items is not implemented
* cleaning up stale files is not implemented

Currently aptly is under heavy development, so please use it with care.

.. contents::

Download
--------

Binary executables (depends almost only on libc) are available for download from `Bintray <https://bintray.com/smira/generic/aptly>`_.

If you have Go environment set up, you can build aptly from source by running::

    go get -d -v github.com/smira/aptly
    go install github.com/smira/aptly

Configuration
-------------

aptly looks for configuration file in ``/etc/aptly.conf`` and ``~/.aptly.conf``, if no config file found,
new one is created. Also aptly needs root directory for database, package and published repository storage.
If not specified, directory defaults to ``~/.aptly``, it will be created if missing.

Configuration file is stored in JSON format::

  {
    "rootDir": "/var/aptly",
    "downloadConcurrency": 4
  }

Options:

* ``rootDir`` is root of directory storage to store datbase (``rootDir/db``), downloaded packages (``rootDir/pool``) and
  published repositories (``rootDir/public``)
* ``downloadConcurrency`` is a number of parallel download threads to use when downloading packages

Example
-------

Create mirror::

  $ aptly mirror create --architecture="amd64" debian-main http://ftp.ru.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main
  2013/12/28 19:44:45 Downloading http://ftp.ru.debian.org/debian/dists/squeeze/Release...
  ...

  Mirror [debian-main]: http://ftp.ru.debian.org/debian/ squeeze successfully added.
  You can run 'aptly mirror update debian-main' to download repository contents.

Take snapshot::

  $ aptly snapshot create debian-3112 from mirror debian-main

  Snapshot debian-3112 successfully created.
  You can run 'aptly publish snapshot debian-3112' to publish snapshot as Debian repository.

Publish snapshot (requires generated GPG key)::

  $ aptly publish snapshot debian-3112

  ...

  Snapshot back has been successfully published.
  Please setup your webserver to serve directory '/var/aptly/public' with autoindexing.
  Now you can add following line to apt sources:
    deb http://your-server/ squeeze main
  Don't forget to add your GPG key to apt with apt-key.

Set up webserver (e.g. nginx)::

  server {
        root /home/example/.aptly/public;
        server_name mirror.local;

        location / {
                autoindex on;
        }

Add new repository to apt's sources::

  deb http://mirror.local/ squeeze main

Run apt-get to fetch repository metadata::

  apt-get update

Enjoy!

Usage
-----

Aptly supports commands in three basic categories:

* ``mirror``
* ``snapshot``
* ``publish``

Command ``mirror``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mirror subcommands manage mirrors of remote Debian repositories.

``aptly mirror create``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates mirror of remote repository. It supports only HTTP repositories.

Usage::

    $ aptly mirror create <name> <archive url> <distribution> [<component1> ...]

Params are:

* ``name`` is a name that would be used in aptly to reference this mirror
* ``archive url`` is a root of archive, e.g. http://ftp.ru.debian.org/debian/
* ``distribution`` is a distribution name, e.g. ``squeeze``
* ``component1`` is an optional list of components to download, if not
  specified aptly would fetch all components, e.g. ``main``

Options:

* ``--architecture="i386,amd64"`` list of architectures to fetch, if not specified,
  aptly would fetch packages for all architectures

Example::

  $ aptly mirror create --architecture="amd64" debian-main http://ftp.ru.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main

  You can run 'aptly mirror update debian-main' to download repository contents.

``aptly mirror update``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updates (fetches packages and meta) remote mirror. When mirror is created, it should be run for the
first time to fetch mirror contents. This command could be run many times. If interrupted, it could
be restarted in a safe way.

Usage::

    $ aptly mirror update <name>

Params are:

* ``name`` is a mirror name (given when mirror was created)

In detailed information, one can see basi—Å parameters of the mirror, filters by component & architecture, timestamp
of last successful repository fetch and number of packages.

Command ``snapshot``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapshot is a fixed state of remote repository. Internally snapshot is list of packages with explicit version.
Snapshot is immutable, i.e. it can't change since it has been created.

``aptly snapshot create .. from mirror``

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Displays list of all created snapshots.

Usage::

  $ aptly snapshot list

Example::

  $ aptly snapshot list
  List of snapshots:
   * [monday-updates]: Snapshot from mirror [backports2]: http://mirror.yandex.ru/backports.org/ squeeze-backports
   * [back]: Snapshot from mirror [backports2]: http://mirror.yandex.ru/backports.org/ squeeze-backports

  To get more information about snapshot, run `aptly snapshot show <name>`.

With snapshot information, basic information about snapshot origin is displayed: which mirror it has been created from.

    oracle-instantclient11.2-basic [amd64]

Command ``publish``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Publishing snapshot as Debian repository which could be served by HTTP/FTP/rsync server. Repository is signed by
user's key with GnuPG. Key should be created beforehand (see section GPG Keys). Published repository could
be consumed directly by apt.

``aptly publish snapshot``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Published repositories appear under ``rootDir/public`` directory.

Usage::

  $ aptly publish snapshot <name> [<prefix>]

Params:

* ``name`` is a snapshot name that snould be published
* ``prefix`` is an optional prefix for publishing, if not specified, repository would be published to the root of
  publi—Å directory

  main
* ``-distribution=""``: distribution name to publish; guessed from original repository distribution
* ``-gpg-key=""``: GPG key ID to use when signing the release, if not specified default key is used

Example::

  $ aptly publish snapshot back
  Signing file '/var/aptly/public/dists/squeeze-backports/Release' with gpg, please enter your passphrase when prompted:

  <<gpg asks for passphrase>>

  Clearsigning file '/var/aptly/public/dists/squeeze-backports/Release' with gpg, please enter your passphrase when prompted:

  <<gpg asks for passphrase>>

  Snapshot back has been successfully published.
  Please setup your webserver to serve directory '/var/aptly/public' with autoindexing.
  Now you can add following line to apt sources:
    deb http://your-server/ squeeze-backports main
  Don't forget to add your GPG key to apt with apt-key.

Directory structure for published repositories::

  public/ - root of published tree (root for webserver)
    dists/
      squeeze/ - distribution name
        Release - raw file
        InRelease - clearsigned file
        Release.gpg - signature for Release file
        binary-i386/
          Packages - list of metadata for packages
          Packages.gz
          Packages.bz2
    pool/
      main/ - component name
        m/
          mars-invaders/
            mars-invaders_1.0.3_i386.deb - package (hard link to package from main pool)

GPG Keys
--------

GPG key is required to sign any published repository. Key should be generated before publishing first repository.

Key generation, storage, backup and revocation is out of scope of this document, there are many tutorials available,
e.g. `this one <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Creating_GPG_Keys>`_.

Publi—Å part of the key should be exported (``gpg --export --armor``) and imported into apt keyring on all machines that would be using
published repositories using ``apt-key``.
