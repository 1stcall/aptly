aptly is a tool to create partial and full mirrors of remote
repositories, manage local repositories, filter them, merge,
upgrade individual packages, take snapshots and publish them
back as Debian repositories.

aptly goal is to establish repeatiblity and controlled changes
in package environment. aptly allows to fix set of packages in
repository, so that package installation and upgrade becomes
deterministic. At the same time aptly allows to perform controlled,
fine-grained changes in repository contents to transition your
package environment to new version.
